01
0:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,366
Voting is a privilege
in this country


02
0:00:01,366 --> 00:00:05,400
and you need to be legal, not
like California with three


03
0:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,166
million alleles vote with it.


04
0:00:07,166 --> 00:00:08,033
Let’s talk about that.


05
0:00:08,033 --> 00:00:11,000
I’m glad I brought
that up that true.


06
0:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,766
So we’re you getting your
information from the media.


07
0:00:14,766 --> 00:00:16,633
Well, I wish the
media some of it.


08
0:00:16,633 --> 00:00:20,366
But CNN I believe, of the
three million illegal people


09
0:00:20,366 --> 00:00:22,966
voted well it was kind
of all across the media.


10
0:00:22,966 --> 00:00:26,700
Well, first it was CNN didn’t
do it then they were being smart


11
0:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,366
this time.


12
0:00:27,366 --> 00:00:29,333
Do you think that
$3 million illegal.


13
0:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,200
I believe in
California that they


14
0:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,333
were alleles that vote, then.


15
0:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,700
I don’t to tell you truth.


16
0:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,866
Nobody really knows that either.


17
0:00:35,866 --> 00:00:38,200
But do you think three
dozen or do you think three.


18
0:00:38,200 --> 00:00:41,133
I think there was a good amount
because the president told


19
0:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,533
people that they could vote.


20
0:00:42,533 --> 00:00:43,300
And it happened in Nashua.


21
0:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,700
We got some people that they
wanted to nashe when they said


22
0:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,200
the president said, I can vote.


23
0:00:48,200 --> 00:00:48,866
I’m here illegally.


24
0:00:48,866 --> 00:00:51,066
You hear President Obama
say that illegal people


25
0:00:51,066 --> 00:00:53,833
could be right or wrong.


26
0:00:53,833 --> 00:00:57,733
So did he ever tell me
where now you could find it.


27
0:00:57,733 --> 00:00:58,266
Google it.


28
0:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,933
You can find it on Facebook.


29
0:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,200
All right hold on.


30
0:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,333
I don’t want to
waste any more time.


31
0:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,066
But anyway, I see
where it came from.


32
0:01:04,066 --> 00:01:07,966
And it’s a Fox Business
Network deceptively


33
0:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,466
edited a clip of Barack Obama
to argue that the president


34
0:01:10,466 --> 00:01:12,866
encourages illegal immigrants
to vote when in fact, he


35
0:01:12,866 --> 00:01:13,633
said nothing of the sort.


36
0:01:13,633 --> 00:01:15,900
When you go back to the
transcript you as you


37
0:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,466
sit here today.


38
0:01:16,466 --> 00:01:20,066
Think that millions of illegal
people voted in this country.


39
0:01:20,066 --> 00:01:23,533
You believe that there was
widespread voting abuse.


40
0:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,966
I think there was in some states
in the millions of people.


41
0:01:26,966 --> 00:01:31,833
I California allows that
people to not allow the legal.


42
0:01:31,833 --> 00:01:32,566
You mean delete.


43
0:01:32,566 --> 00:01:35,200
You mean voter fraud.


44
0:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,300
California allows.


45
0:01:36,300 --> 00:01:36,300
I believe there was voter
fraud in this country.
